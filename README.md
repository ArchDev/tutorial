# scalafix - rewrite your code to use new APIs

There is nothing yet to see here.

The [first meeting of the Scala Center advisory board](http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/05/30/scala-center-advisory-board.html#the-first-meeting)
approved a proposal to define a migration path from Scala 2.x to Dotty.
The developed tools to achieve that goal will be hosted in this repository.
